# What are AI agents?

* An AI agent is an entity that can act autonomously in an environment. It can take information from its surroundings, make decisions based on that data, and act to transform those circumstances—physical, digital, or mixed. More advanced systems can learn and update their behavior over time, constantly trying out new solutions to a problem until they achieve the goal.

* Some agents can be seen in the real world—as robots, automated drones, or self-driving cars. Others are purely software-based, running inside computers to complete tasks. The actual aspect, components, and interface of each AI agent vary widely depending on the task it's meant to work on.

* AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perform tasks, make decisions, or achieve specific goals with minimal human intervention. These agents operate within a defined environment, interacting with their surroundings, and using artificial intelligence techniques to process information, learn from experiences, and adapt their behavior accordingly.
