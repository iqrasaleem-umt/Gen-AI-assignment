# What are GPTs? What are features and use cases of custom GPTs?

# GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers):
*  Type of artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. They are based on the Transformer architecture and are designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. GPT models are trained on large datasets of text and can generate human-like text, making them capable of understanding and generating natural language.
* GPT is a language model that uses natural language processing and artificial intelligence to have human-like text conversations and perform tasks. It's used to generate natural language text and has advanced capabilities that can be used for various business purposes.
* People have used GPT to help them write articles and books, find bugs in development codes, solve complex problems, and even diagnose illnesses. This language model can answer questions and perform tasks like writing messages, code, and emails.
* It's even intelligent enough to teach you how to perform various tasks. It responds in an informal language that is easy for most people to understand.
Efficient Processing: NPUs are designed to efficiently perform the operations required for neural networks, including matrix multiplication and convolution, which are computationally intensive.

# custom gpt
* Custom GPTs can be integrated into various applications, including chatbots, customer service platforms, personal assistants, and more.
They can interact via text or voice, depending on the application's requirements.
Scalability:
* These models are designed to handle large volumes of interactions, making them suitable for businesses and services with high user engagement.
Continuous Improvement:
* OpenAI Custom GPTs can learn from interactions and feedback to improve their performance over time, ensuring that they stay relevant and accurate.
* GPTs offer the flexibility to cater to specific requirements, making them a valuable tool for businesses and individuals seeking to leverage AI for various applications.
